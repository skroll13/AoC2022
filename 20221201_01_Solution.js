// to start:
// import txt file
// parse data into an array
// array of strings?
// add each string, or whatever the small sets are, up
// compare each string, or whatever the small sets are, to each other to find the largest in the group

// ideas:
// from Loren:
// it was kind of a 2D array separated by double line breaks, though I processed it into one number per elf while I was reading in the file
// so, add the first number to the second number and then add that to the third number, and so on, until you hit a line break. 
// then, stop adding. after the line break, add the numbers together again. repeat
